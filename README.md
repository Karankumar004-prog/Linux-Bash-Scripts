# Linux-Bash-Scripts
Here are some scripts for automation, customization and for ethical hacking.

Customiztion:
1) Modifyshell.sh 
        This Bash script customizes the default terminal appearance for Debian-based Linux distributions (like Ubuntu, Kali, Parrot OS, etc.) to give it a more modern, readable, and hacker-friendly interface.

        üé® Terminal Color & Style Modifications
        ‚úÖ Prompt Customization (PS1):
        Displays the terminal prompt in a clean, color-coded format:
        {username}@{hostname} ‚Üí bold orange
        Current directory (PWD) ‚Üí light green
        Looks consistent across both normal and root users.
        
        ‚úÖ Colored File Listings (ls, ll, etc.):
        Uses a customized LS_COLORS scheme:
        Directories: bold orange
        Regular files: yellow
        Executable files: white
        Symbolic links: cyan
        Ensures improved visibility in large or complex directory trees.
        
        ‚úÖ Command & Error Display:
        Commands appear in white for clarity.
        Errors (stderr) are displayed in red, preserving Bash's default behavior.

        üñºÔ∏è Terminal Banner Enhancements
        ‚úÖ Welcome Banner:
        On opening a new terminal session, the screen:
        Clears automatically
        Displays a custom ASCII banner using figlet, piped through lolcat for a vibrant, colored splash
        
        ‚úÖ System Info Display:
        Launches neofetch on each new session
        Shows a clean summary of your OS, hardware, memory, uptime, and more ‚Äî Kali-style
        
        üì¶ Additional Features
        Installs required tools: figlet, lolcat, neofetch, and bash-completion
        Supports tab-completion for commands and file paths (via bash-completion)
        Automatically backs up your existing .bashrc before applying changes
        Works seamlessly for both non-root and root users
        Use this script to instantly enhance your terminal environment for better clarity, readability, and that Kali Linux aesthetic ‚Äî all without changing your OS.
